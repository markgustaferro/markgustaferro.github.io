        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            I graduated from Yale in 2021 with a degree in Economics and a certificate in Statistics & Data Science.  During my time as an undergrad,
            I managed and performed with The Yale Alley Cats and The Yale Whiffenpoofs, two of Yale's oldest and most renowned a cappella groups.  On the side,
            I also served as the Development Chair for the Yale Historical Review.

            Recently, I moved from Minneapolis to the Bay Area to start a career in consulting.  In my (limited) free time, I enjoy cooking, hiking, skiing,
            keeping up with the latest in tech, reading John Le Carr√© spy novels, and solving math puzzles.
